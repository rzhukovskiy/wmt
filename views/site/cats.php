            <span class="description">
                4 years old mayne coon<br />
                He is red. And he is funny. He likes to play with his toys sinking them in the water<br />
                And all my cables are chewed. This little devil destroyed so many glasses and balls with a snow<br />
                His favorite toy is unpuddle<br />
                Kaiser is crazy a little bit, but we still love him

                Punsh is the eldest between our two cats<br />
                His weight is about 12 kilograms<br />
                He is very cute and clever. And he is very serious. He help us with all everyday routine<br />
                He is the best cat in the world<br />
                But he has gone in this year. Right after we came to Italia. We really miss him
